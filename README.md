# Databricks: COVID-19 Vaccination Impact Analysis  

## 🌍 Overview
This project delivers a sophisticated data-driven investigation into the critical question: **Are higher COVID-19 vaccination rates associated with fewer cases and reduced mortality globally?** Utilizing robust datasets from Our World in Data, World Bank, and Wikipedia; I examine vaccination impact trends across multiple continents to assess how vaccination rates might correlate with COVID-19 case reductions and excess mortality rates.

Harnessing Databricks' powerful cloud-based environment, I capitalize on its scalability and efficiency to perform in-depth data preparation, analysis, and visualization. Through PySpark, advanced data filtering, and analytical modeling, I meticulously process and analyze data to reveal potential correlations and insights. The study particularly focuses on the months of ```September 2021``` and ```October 2021```, allowing for a snapshot analysis during the ongoing pandemic’s most critical phase.
